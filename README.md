# The Syglass Recording Guide

This doccumentation will help you learn the ins and outs of making a presentation / narration with SyGlass!

## Importing projects
In order to import a project into syglass, navigate to the **file** button at the top menu bar. From there, if creating a new project, select the "create new project" button. Otherwise, select "Import Existing Project"

Pressing "Create New Project" will open the [New Project Wizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X5R60u8V6U) From there, you're able to add the volumetric data files that you'd like included in your project. Once you have them selected, hit the Next button which allows you to speficy more settings, such as choosing a channel and importing visualization settings from another project.

## Loading Projects
Naviagate to the Project Library tab on the left side of your Syglass application. To import a project, simply right click on the project you'd like to import, and press "Launch Project". From there, you should see the project you selected loaded into your Syglass enviornment.

### Loading Multiple Projects
In order to load multiple projects into the same environment, hold down the **control** button on your keyboard, and left click on the projects you'd like to import to highlight them. Once you have your desired rpojects selected, right-click while still holding control and press "Launch Project".

## Using Virtual Reality
Looking in the bottom right corner of your Syglass environment, you should see a white VR helmet with "off" written underneath it. This button enables you to enter and exit virtual reality mode. By turning it on and selecting "SteamVR", the viewmode will change from desktop to VR and you will be able to interact with the scene using your headset and controllers.

### The Controllers
The 3 important buttons you'll be using on your controller are the **touchpad**, **menu button**, and the **trigger**

**Touchpad:**
- Pressing down on the touchpad enables the radial menu. With the radial menu, you're able to select different abilities or settings for the current tool on each controller.

**Menu Button:**
- The menu button opens a menu which allows for various settings changes. You're able to change your projects visualization settings, your selected tool for each controller, as well as render settings.

**Trigger:**
- The trigger allows you to utilize the selected tool for each controller, as well as moving around your project or other objects in the your VR environment.

## Adjusting visualization settings
After loading your project, you'll be able to change the visualization settings of the project using an interactive menu.

By pressing "control" on the keyboard, or the menu button on your Virtual Reality controller, the visualization menu will open.

At the top of the menu, you'll see a variety of visualization options, with settings sliders underneath them.

### Settings Sliders
[**Stride**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8EJ20cAU8&t=31s)
- Stride adjusts the "noisiness" of your project. Increasing the stride will generally decrease the quality of your volume (making it appear more jittery), while decreasing the slide increases the quality and makes it more clear. It's not reccomended to have strive at 0 until recording, as it will casue your project to lag.

**Opacity**
- Opacity changes the opacity of your image. Lowering the opacity makes the volume more transparent, and increasing the opacity makes it more opaque.

[**Intensity**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8EJ20cAU8&t=43s)
- Intensity alters the brightness of your project. Increasing the intensity makes the volume appear brighter, while devreasing intensity makes it darker.

[**Contrast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8EJ20cAU8&t=51s)
- Contrast adjusts the gamma-correction of your volume. By increasing and decreasing the contrast, you're able to make some lighter values less visible, revealing details that might be hidden deeper in the volume.

[**Window**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8EJ20cAU8&t=67s)
- Window is one of two sliders that has 2 adjustable values.
- Values *less* than the first slider will become black (less intense)
- Values *higher* than the second slider will become white (more intense)

[**Threshold**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8EJ20cAU8&t=87s)
- Threshold also includes 2 adjustable values.
- Values not in range of the two sliders will dissapear completely
